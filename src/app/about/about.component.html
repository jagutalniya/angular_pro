        <p>
            Our Student Management System is designed to simplify and digitize school operations — from multiple school
            handling by Super Admin to class management by teachers.
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3">
            <li>🧑‍💼 Super Admin can manage multiple schools independently.</li>
            <li>🏫 Each School Admin can manage their own teachers and students.</li>
            <li>👨‍🏫 Teachers can view and manage students of their assigned classes only.</li>
            <li>🎓 Students can view their profile, academic info, and class details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3 text-muted">
            This system was created with the vision to empower rural and semi-urban schools digitally — with the first
            example being <strong>Talniya Public School, Degana</strong>.
